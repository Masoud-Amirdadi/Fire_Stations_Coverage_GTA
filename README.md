This interactive GIS-based visualization tool presents an integrated view of fire-service coverage for the cities of Toronto and Mississauga within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Ontario, Canada. Developed as part of an applied optimization and spatial-analytics framework, the tool brings together geospatial modeling, service-area estimation, and data-driven decision-support methods in a lightweight, browser-based platform.

The system incorporates buffer-based isochrones and Voronoi-based partitions to model and compare fire-station influence areas. Two scenarios are included:

Distance-Only Service Areas, representing traditional proximity-based coverage.

Distance + Incident-Intensity Service Areas, where historical emergency-incident density reshapes the polygons to better capture operational demand.

Comparing these scenarios allows users to explore how geography, density, and station workload affect effective coverage across the two municipalities.

The platform provides deeper analytical capabilities than typical static municipal tools—for example, the City of Toronto’s official fire-station locator can be found at

but this interactive tool extends beyond location display by enabling scenario-based coverage exploration, incident-adjusted modeling, and regional comparisons.
