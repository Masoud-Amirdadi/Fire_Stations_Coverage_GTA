This interactive GIS tool visualizes fire-station service areas across Toronto and Mississauga using buffer-based isochrones, Voronoi partitions, and incident-intensity adjustments. Two scenarios are included distance-only coverage and distance + incident-intensity coverage, to show how geography and operational demand shape service reach.

The tool has been inspired by public visualization platforms such as the City of Toronto’s official fire-station map (available here: https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/understanding-emergency-services/fire-station-locations).
However, this interactive tool extends beyond simple location display by enabling scenario-based coverage exploration, incident-adjusted modeling, and cross-city regional comparisons.

It supports researchers, planners, and the public in understanding spatial accessibility and fire-service performance across the two municipalities.
