An interactive GIS tool for exploring fire-station service areas across the cities of Toronto and Mississauga in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). The platform integrates spatial optimization, buffer-based isochrones, Voronoi partitions, and incident-intensity analytics to help visualize and compare emergency-service coverage.

This tool includes two scenario types:

Distance-Only Coverage – traditional proximity-based service areas.

Distance + Incident-Intensity Coverage – coverage zones adjusted for historical emergency-incident density.

It offers deeper analytical capabilities than static municipal tools such as the City of Toronto’s official fire-station locator, available here: https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/understanding-emergency-services/fire-station-locations
